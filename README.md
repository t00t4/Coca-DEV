👋 Hi, I’m @t00t4!

-  👀 I’m interested in hacking (the ethical kind, of course!)
-  🌱 I’m currently learning all things hacking - from penetration testing to ethical exploits.
-  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hacking projects, CTF challenges, and cybersecurity endeavors.
-  📫 How to reach me: try hacking my social media... just kidding!

Let's make the digital world a safer place, one hack at a time! 😄
